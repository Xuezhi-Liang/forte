        """An implementation from the dataframe-like data tuple object.

                This class stores entries by types in different lists. It
                uses an array to store these SortedLists with the structure:
                array([Document SortedList, Sentence SortedList, ...]).
                Different types of annotations, like sentence, tokens and documents,
                are stored in different SortedLists.

                This class records the order of the array and assigns type id,
                which is the index of each sortedlist, to each entry type.

                Each entry list in the SortedList has the format of
                [entry_type, tid, begin, end, attr_1, attr_2, ..., attr_n]
                The first four fields are compulsory for every entry type.
                Each entry type has a fixed field of attributes.
                E.g. Document SortedList has lists of structure:
                [entry_type, tid, begin, end, document_class,sentiment,classifications]
